# 🏆 Decentralized Sports Betting DApp

## 1. Project Title
**DecentralBet** - Peer-to-Peer Sports Betting Platform

## 2. Project Vision
To create a transparent, trustless, and decentralized sports betting ecosystem where users can create and participate in betting markets without relying on traditional bookmakers or intermediaries. Our vision is to democratize sports betting by eliminating centralized control, reducing fees, and ensuring fair payouts through smart contract automation.

## 3. Project Description
DecentralBet is a blockchain-based sports betting platform that enables peer-to-peer wagering on sporting events. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, the platform allows users to:

- **Create Custom Betting Markets**: Any user can create a betting market for upcoming sports events
- **Place Decentralized Bets**: Users bet directly against each other, not against the house
- **Transparent Resolution**: Market outcomes are resolved transparently with verifiable results
- **Automatic Payouts**: Winners receive their payouts automatically through smart contracts
- **Fair Fee Structure**: Minimal platform fees (2%) compared to traditional sportsbooks (5-10%)

The platform operates entirely on-chain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and eliminating the need for trusted third parties. All betting logic, fund management, and payout calculations are handled by smart contracts.
